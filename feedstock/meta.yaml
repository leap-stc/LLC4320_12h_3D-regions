title: "High-resolution ocean simulation (LLC4320) 12-hourly averaged 3D regions"
description: |
  The LLC4320 is an ocean only simulation forced by 6 hourly atmospheric fields, 
  which was run at NASA JPL by Dimitris Menemenlis. These are 12 hourly averaged 
  fields for from 12 different regions in the ocean, each roughly 10degrees by 
  10degrees in size, for the top 700m of the water column. There five 3D variables: 
  Temperature, Salinity, and 3 components of velocity, and four 2D surface fields:
  Boundary layer depth, surface heat flux, and 2 components of wind stress.
  Note that this is a small part of the original dataset which has been processed and 
  sub-sampled to make the size more manageable.
