This repository serves as template/documentation/testing ground for Leap-Pangeo Data Library Feedstocks.

### Add your dataset to the LEAP-Pangeo Catalog
Now that your awesome dataset is available as an ARCO zarr store, you should make sure that everyone else at LEAP can check this dataset out easily.
Open a PR to our [catalog input file](https://github.com/leap-stc/data-management/blob/main/catalog/input.yaml) and add a link to this repos `'catalog.yaml'` there. See [here](https://github.com/leap-stc/data-management/pull/132) for an example PR for the [`arco-era5_feedstock](https://github.com/leap-stc/arco-era5_feedstock).
